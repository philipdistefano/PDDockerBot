# PDDockerBot
A Discord bot that lets you control your Docker containers (coming soon)
---
**Why?**

Yes there are other Docker bots for Discord, but none of them that I could find did exactly what I wanted, so I made my own and decided to share it.

**Features**

* Set Docker host (default host will be set in an environment variable for now)
* List containers
* List containers with status (started, stopped, exited, etc)
* Start containers
* Stop containers
* Rename containers

**Requirements**

Docker Remote API enabled - https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/how-and-why-to-use-a-remote-docker-host/
